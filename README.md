# EntroPass

A wordlist generator to help create wordlists with a specific target in mind. Use the configuration file to enter words that relate to the target (hobby, pets, car, etc.) and configure the program to generate the output. The program is  capable of generating massive wordlists, but can also be configured to filter most out if desired. If you need some inspiration on what information was found to be most relevant for passwords, take a look at the research paper.
